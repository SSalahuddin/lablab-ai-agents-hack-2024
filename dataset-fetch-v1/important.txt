About app.py:
-------------
1. Initializes and connects with google earth engine
2. Define a point around which to get the S2 image
3. Load the Sentinel-2 image collection and filter by date and location
4. Get the first image in the filtered collection
5. Select relevant bands (e.g., RGB bands: B4, B3, B2)
6. Define the region (smaller bounding box around the point, e.g., 1 km buffer)
7. Create an export task to Google Drive
8. Start the export task and saves in Google Drive


Once the image is available in Google Drive, it is downloaded manually as GeoTIFF file and can be displayed using show-image.py.


About show-image.py:
--------------------
1. Path to the downloaded GeoTIFF file
2. Open the image with rasterio
3. Read the image bands (B4: red, B3: green, B2: blue)
4. Stack the bands to create an RGB image
5. Normalize the pixel values to 0-1 for display purposes (since Sentinel-2 values range from 0 to 10,000+)
6. Plot the image using matplotlib
